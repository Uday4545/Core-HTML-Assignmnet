    <p>Hey there, I'm Uday! I'm not just a name; I'm a story in the making. My journey into the fascinating world of computer science began at K R Puram Government First Grade College in Bangalore, where I embarked on my quest for knowledge. Fast forward to today, and I proudly hold a BSc in Computer Science â€“ a testament to my dedication and passion for all things tech. <br> <br> My college days armed me with a strong foundation in computer science, and that knowledge is my secret weapon in web development. It helps me understand not just how to build amazing websites but also why they work the way they do.</p>
